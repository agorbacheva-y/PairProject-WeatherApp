# Weather App

Pair Project: Olcay Tapan and Ayumi Gorbacheva-Yamamoto

Brief: Create a weather app using the Open Weather Map API that shows city name, current temperature, weather type, sunrise time, sunset time, five-day forecast.

Design: We picked the provided Design #1: https://www.figma.com/file/6puPcWV9EFpf2lpSjszm5E/Weather-app?type=design&node-id=1-2&mode=design&t=BjCsphOzyXsEiI5N-0 

## The problem

The API used was openweathermap.org. Once we stumbled upon a problem, we used google, stack overflow and w3schools to find help.

If we had more time, we would make the app more accurate - have more weather options (and designs) in our if-else statements.
